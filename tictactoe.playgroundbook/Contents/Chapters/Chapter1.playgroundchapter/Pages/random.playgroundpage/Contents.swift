 # First steps

 Each square is represented by a number. Your goal is, given the state of the game, find the number for the best possible move.

      .-----------.
      | 0 | 1 | 2 |
      |---+---+---|
      | 3 | 4 | 5 |
      |---+---+---|
      | 6 | 7 | 8 |
      `-----------'

 The function below gets called every time the robot is about to play and returns the number of the best square.
 Your robot will play as player O. Normally, player X plays first, so we are giving advantage to the human opponent!

 Let's start by implementing a simple strategy: return any square that is free
