# Congratulations! You just coded an unbeatable noughts and crosses AI! ðŸŽ‰

This algorithm is also known as the *Min-max algorithm* in Game Theory. The name refers to minimising the
maximum possible loss. By playing in this way, our algorithm is unbeatable!

The Min-max algorithm can be opitmised and adapted for many other games, and is an important decision-making rule in game theory and artifical intelligence. If you want to learn more, feel free to google "zero-sum games".

Thanks for following along!
