 Consider the following scenario:

 If we don't play the lower left square, then our opponent would be able to win at the next move!

 Clearly, we should put more thought into chosing a square. That's why the function on this
 page is slightly different -- read along with the code and fill in the gaps!

Let's calculate a score for this move before putting it in the list!

When we play, we don't take risks. That's why we always assume the opponent will take the
move that works best for them.

How do we know what move the opponent will made? Simple: since we always take the
best move, it's the same move we would make if we were in their position.

 Then, we look at the score of that move: if it's good for them, it's bad for us. Conversely, if it's bad for them, it's good for us!

 * Callout(Your task):
In the field below, calculate the negative of the score the opponent would get. That is, you need to call `play(game: )` with `newGame`, get the score (`.score`) and negate the whole expression by putting a minus sign in front.
