 # A simple strategy

 Consider the following scenario:

     O's turn:
     .-----------.
     | X |   |   |
     |---+---+---|
     |   | X | O |
     |---+---+---|
     | X |   | O |
     `-----------'

 Clearly, it is best if O plays in the upper right corner and win. However, if we play
 randomly, we would miss that opportunity!

 Let's modify our function to seize such opportunities: if we find a square that would score a win, return it without considering the remaining options.

    var possibleMoves: [Int] = []

    for move in game.emptyCells {
        // What the game would look like if we played that move
        var newGame = game
        newGame.cells[move] = game.currentPlayer
        // Check the result of that hypothetical game
        switch newGame.result() {
